# smart-city-mini-project
       The Smart City Management System is a desktop-based Java application developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for persistent data storage. This project is designed to support city administrators or users in efficiently managing and locating city infrastructure entities such as ATMs, Parks, Hospitals, and more. The system provides an intuitive form-based interface where users can add new locations by entering the address and description, and categorize them based on type. Additionally, users can search for locations by type and view results instantly in a structured table format within the GUI.

This application acts as a mini Geographic Information System (GIS) model tailored for urban data management. It serves as a practical and educational tool for beginners learning about integrating Java with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), managing MySQL databases, and building interactive GUI applications using Swing components such as JTable, JTextField, JComboBox, and JButton. All user actions, such as adding or searching data, are directly reflected in the backend MySQL database, showcasing real-time CRUD operations.

The project promotes modularity and best practices in GUI design and event-driven programming. It also introduces users to the basics of software layering, where the presentation layer (Swing UI) and data handling (SQL backend) interact seamlessly. This solution can be further expanded into a web-based model, mobile app, or even integrated with map APIs for real-world deployment.
